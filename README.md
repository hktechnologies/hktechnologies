- 👋 Hi, I’m @honey_boy
- 👀 I believe in the philosophy of each day being anew to learn something you haven't learned before, so in that spirit, what are you learning today?
- 🌱 My experiences fall under the art of IT system consultancy, primarily assisting with operations management and system architecture design for SMBs.
- 🌎 My current personal portfolio projects includes building apps and workflow automations using Python 3.x to build towards a mastered proficiency. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a video game project for a small-scale open world, third-perspective action-strategy game set in Ancient Greece, or possibly in a small community settings as a sandbox environment for full-scale growth. 
- 📫 I can be reached at shareif.parker@honeyktechnologies.com
